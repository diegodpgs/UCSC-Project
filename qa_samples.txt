===WH-QUESTIONS===

For Who ands What: in dsyntnode where class=“verb” rel="II”, set question=“+”

Who: in dysyntnode where class=“common_noun” or “proper_noun” only, i.e., where gender and pro attributes make sense
     pro=“wh” gender=“fem"
     pro=“wh” gender=“masc"
What: in dysyntnode where class=“common_noun” or “proper_noun” only, i.e., where gender and pro attributes make sense
     pro=“wh”

When, Where, Why, How: 
Take away the whole preposition subtree (headed by in, on, because, etc.), replace with a single node, with lexeme=“when”, “where”, “why”, or “how” and rel=“ATTR"

Which:
On the head of the subtree which we want to front, set wh=“+”
     E.g. “The crow sat [on the tree’s branch]."
       vs. “[On which tree’s branch] did the crow sit?”
Then, under this node, find the "leafest" node with class=“common_noun” or “proper_noun”, set its article=“no-art", add a node under it with lexeme=“which” and rel=“ATTR"
     E.g. “The crow sat on the apple tree’s branch."
        vs.“On which apple tree’s branch did the crow sit?"
     However, if the leafest node is coordinated by a conjunction word, add the “which” node under the first argument in the conjunction
     E.g. *“On [apple and which pear] tree’s branch did the crow sit?"
         vs.“On [which apple and pear] tree’s branch did the crow sit?"


* asterisk notation indicates bad sentences
